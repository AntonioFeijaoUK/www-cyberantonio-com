title: learning by doing
---

I love the fact that by doing, I am learning!

That is probably why I have so much to do!

Sometimes I need to pause.... to rest, for family, and to process what I learned and get ready to learn even more!

Remember, listening and reflecting are very important!

Feeling inspired?
