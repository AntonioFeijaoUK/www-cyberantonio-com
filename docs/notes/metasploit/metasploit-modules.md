metasploit modules

* Exploits

> a sequence of commands used to target a specific vulnerability in a target system.

* Payloads

> malicious code that allows access to and runs in the target system after a vulnerability is exploited, including connecting to the target.

* Auxiliary

> used to perform actions outside a payload, not always directly related to exploitation, such as DoS attacks or scanners.

* Post-exploitation

> a module that allows you to gain access or more information on the exploited system.

* NOPs

> a generator that is used to bypass standard IDS and IPS NOP sled signatures.
